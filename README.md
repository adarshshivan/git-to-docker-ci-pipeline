# Git-to-Docker CI Pipeline

This project demonstrates a foundational DevOps workflow that starts from source code management using Git and progresses through containerization using Docker, with Continuous Integration principles applied.

The objective of this project is to establish a clean repository structure that can later be extended to include:
- Automated CI pipelines
- Container image builds
- Deployment strategies
- Monitoring and observability

This repository is part of a larger DevOps learning roadmap and will evolve step by step.
