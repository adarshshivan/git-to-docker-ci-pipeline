# Project Overview

The **Git-to-Docker CI Pipeline** project demonstrates an end-to-end DevOps workflow that automates the process of building, validating, and publishing a Docker image using GitHub Actions.

The project starts with a simple Python application and progressively adds:
- Containerization using Docker
- Continuous Integration using GitHub Actions
- Dockerfile linting and CI hardening
- Secure image publishing to Docker Hub

This project is designed to showcase real-world DevOps practices such as reproducible builds, CI-driven artifact publishing, and secure credential handling.
