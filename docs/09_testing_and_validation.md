# Testing and Validation

## Local Validation
- Docker image built locally
- Container run and application tested on localhost

## CI Validation
- Successful GitHub Actions pipeline execution
- Verified Docker push logs

## External Validation
- Image pulled and executed on a separate machine
- No source code or local setup required

This confirms full portability of the container image.
